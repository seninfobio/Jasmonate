**Jasmonates are well recognized lipid-derived stress hormones that regulate plant adaptations to biotic stresses, including herbivore attack and pathogen infection, as well as abiotic stresses, including wounding, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation.**
        
  - Also have functions in a remarkable number of plant developmental events, including primary root growth, reproductive development, and leaf senescence
  -  In general, JA promotes defense and reproduction while inhibiting growth-related processes such as cell division and photosynthesis

[The core components of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) protein, JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN PROTEIN (JAZ), and MYC constitute the core signal transduction mechanism of JA signaling. Under control conditions, the endogenous level of JA–isoleucine (Ile) is very low plants. JAZ repressors bind to MYC2 to inhibit its transcriptional activation on downstream genes. Under stress conditions, the endogenous level of JA–Ile is largely activated, which is perceived by JA receptor COI1. Then SKP1/CULLIN/F-box (SCF)COI1 binds to JAZs for ubiquitination and degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway, resulting in the release of the downstream transcription factors (TFs) such as MYCs and the activation of JA responses]

Summary of core jasmonates-regulated signaling modules involved in specific response in rice. The core signaling module constitutes JA-Ile/OsCOI/OsJAZ/TFs. Input signals from biotic attacks or abiotic stresses, such as salinity, cold, drought…, trigger the accumulation of JA/JA-Ile. JA-Ile is perceived by the OsCOI protein receptor and promotes degradation of JAZ proteins through the 26S proteasome manner. Degradation of OsJAZ relieves repression on the OsJAZ-interacting transcription factors (such as OsMYC2, OsbHLH062, and OsbHLH094) that govern specific physiological output responses involved in growth, development, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, this simplified scheme does not negate the fact that many OsJAZ proteins functionally interact with multiple transcription factors. Arrows represent positive regulatory actions. Lines ending in a flat head indicate a negative regulatory action. Dashed lines represent interactions that have not been experimentally confirmed. Double-headed arrows indicate that two proteins interact.
