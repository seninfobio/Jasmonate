# Jasmonate
**Jasmonates are well recognized lipid-derived stress hormones that regulate plant adaptations to biotic stresses, including herbivore attack and pathogen infection, as well as abiotic stresses, including wounding, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation.**
        
  - Also have functions in a remarkable number of plant developmental events, including primary root growth, reproductive development, and leaf senescence

![img_The core components of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in rice, tobacco, and Arabidopsis. CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) protein, JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN PROTEIN (JAZ), and MYC constitute the core signal transduction mechanism of JA signaling. Under control conditions, the endogenous level of JA–isoleucine (Ile) is very low plants. JAZ repressors bind to MYC2 to inhibit its transcriptional activation on downstream genes. Under stress conditions, the endogenous level of JA–Ile is largely activated, which is perceived by JA receptor COI1. Then SKP1/CULLIN/F-box (SCF)COI1 binds to JAZs for ubiquitination and degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway, resulting in the release of the downstream transcription factors (TFs) such as MYCs and the activation of JA responses.](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/458580/fpls-10-01349-HTML/image_m/fpls-10-01349-g001.jpg)
