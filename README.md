# Jasmonate
**Jasmonates are well recognized lipid-derived stress hormones that regulate plant adaptations to biotic stresses, including herbivore attack and pathogen infection, as well as abiotic stresses, including wounding, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation.**
        
  - Also have functions in a remarkable number of plant developmental events, including primary root growth, reproductive development, and leaf senescence
